    <h3>The Idea</h3>
    <p>The idea behind TechTechMentr was to provide an online resource for individuals looking to learn about technology in a friendly environment. We aim to match mentors to you based on your preferences. You can chat to them in real time, meet up with them face-to-face or even email them from time to time if you're an intermittent user</p>

    <h3>The founders</h3>
    <p>We, as female developers, first came up with the idea when we were thinking about our own experiences in Technology. The concensus that was drawn was that there would have been value in being able to match female role models with female students in the field looking for assistance. Be they looking for help during their courses, or simply looking for a friendly environment in which to learn outside of their work environment. For whatever reason, female developers in particular struggle in certain environments to get the help and support they need to reach their full potential. We hope to plug that gap</p>
